# Multimodal Fallacy Classification in  Political Debates
This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Multimodal Fallacy Classification in Argument Mining," focusing on the exploration of audio's role in classifying argumentative fallacies in political debates.

## Dataset: MM-USED-fallacies

The repository includes the code required to generate the MM-USED-fallacies dataset. This dataset is created by leveraging resources from the [MM-USED](https://github.com/federicoruggeri/multimodal-am/tree/main/multimodal-dataset) dataset and the [USED-fallacy](https://github.com/pierpaologoffredo/IJCAI2022) dataset. By incorporating multimodal techniques, we aim to enrich the fallacy analysis beyond traditional text-based information, specifically by incorporating audio data from political debates.

## Repository Structure

- `data-creation/`: This directory contains the necessary resources and data files for generating the MM-USED-fallacies dataset.
- `experiments/`: This directory contains the necessary resources and data files for running the experiments.
- TODO: Add more details on the directory structure.
