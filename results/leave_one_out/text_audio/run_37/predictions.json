        "4":"In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. ",
        "5":"In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world. ",
        "6":"Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. ",
        "7":"In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. ",
        "8":"Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. ",
        "9":"Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. ",
        "10":"General Ridgway has said the same thing. ",
        "11":"But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on. ",
        "12":"I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. ",
        "13":"Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us. ",
        "14":"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn\\'t speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: 'The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.' ",
        "15":"We have to practice what we preach. ",
        "16":"Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it. ",
        "17":"And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following. ",
        "18":"So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men. ",
        "19":"Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been. ",
        "20":"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well. ",
        "21":"We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. ",
        "22":"But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation. ",
        "23":"This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men. ",
        "24":"Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party. Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken. ",
        "25":"That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment. ",
        "26":"And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one. ",
        "27":"And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. ",
        "28":"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty. ",
        "29":"Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? ",
        "30":"In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. ",
        "31":"When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. ",
        "32":"And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. ",
        "33":"And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. ",
        "34":"Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don't believe it is. I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing. ",
        "35":"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen. ",
        "36":"I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign. ",
        "37":"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want. ",
        "38":"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? ",
        "39":"Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world. ",
        "40":"Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong. ",
        "41":"Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first. ",
        "42":"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. ",
        "43":"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. ",
        "44":"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. ",
        "45":"I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. ",
        "46":"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. ",
        "47":"I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. ",
        "48":"Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. ",
        "49":"I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. ",
        "50":"He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. ",
        "51":"It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best. ",
        "52":"We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people. ",
        "53":"Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform. ",
        "54":"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. ",
        "55":"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa. ",
        "56":"And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence. ",
        "57":"I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace. ",
        "58":"And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing. ",
        "59":"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars. ",
        "60":"Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation? Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world? ",
        "61":"That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country. ",
        "62":"We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal. It didn't happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. ",
        "63":"Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight. ",
        "64":"In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment. ",
        "65":"The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people. ",
        "66":"And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state. ",
        "67":"If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. ",
        "68":"This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed. ",
        "69":"Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts. ",
        "70":"And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world. ",
        "71":"We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. ",
        "72":"I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. ",
        "73":"This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. ",
        "74":"If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president. ",
        "75":"And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month. ",
        "76":"We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office. ",
        "77":"Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home. ",
        "78":"I know I'm ready for it. I think the American people are too. ",
        "79":"Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools. ",
        "80":"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment. ",
        "81":"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. ",
        "82":"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office. ",
        "83":"And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. ",
        "84":"That is a very serious indictment of this administration. It's probably the worst one of all. ",
        "85":"Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year. ",
        "86":"I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. ",
        "87":"I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions. ",
        "88":"The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. ",
        "89":"The American people are healed, are working together. ",
        "90":"Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. ",
        "91":"Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess. ",
        "92":"I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. ",
        "93":"The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. ",
        "94":"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, 'I believe our nation is greater than what we are now.' ",
        "95":"I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials. ",
        "96":"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation. ",
        "97":"I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense. ",
        "98":"I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised. ",
        "99":"I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it. ",
        "100":"Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military. ",
        "101":"I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown. ",
        "102":"We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. ",
        "103":"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, 'Ford to New York: Drop Dead.' ",
        "104":"I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. "

        "16":"And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.",
        "17":"And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.",

Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.",

        "43":"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.",

        "59":"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures",
        "60":"Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation? Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?",
        "61":"a ridiculous thing",
        "62":"We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal. It didn't happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today.",

        "74":"If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.",

        "85":"Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.",
        "86":"I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.",
        "87":"I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions.",

        "98":"I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.",
        "99":"I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.",
