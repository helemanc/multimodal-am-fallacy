        "28":"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty. ",
        "29":"Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? ",
        "30":"In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. ",
        "31":"When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. ",
        "32":"And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. ",
        "33":"And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. ",
        "34":"Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don't believe it is. I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing. ",
        "35":"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen. ",
        "36":"I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign. ",
        "37":"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want. ",
        "38":"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? ",
        "39":"Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world. ",
        "40":"Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong. ",
        "41":"Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first. ",
        "42":"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. ",
        "43":"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. ",
        "44":"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. ",
        "45":"I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. ",
        "46":"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. ",
        "47":"I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. ",
        "48":"Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. ",
        "49":"I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. ",
        "50":"He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. ",
        "51":"It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best. ",
        "52":"We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people. ",
        "53":"Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform. ",
        "54":"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. ",
        "55":"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa. ",
        "56":"And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence. ",
        "57":"I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace. ",
        "58":"And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing. ",
        "59":"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars. ",
        "60":"Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation? Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world? ",
        "61":"That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country. ",
        "62":"We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal. It didn't happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. ",
        "63":"Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight. ",
        "64":"In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment. ",
        "65":"The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people. ",
        "66":"And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state. ",
        "67":"If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. ",
        "68":"This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed. ",
        "69":"Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts. ",
        "70":"And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world. ",
        "71":"We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. ",
        "72":"I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. ",
        "73":"This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. ",
        "74":"If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president. ",
        "75":"And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month. ",
        "76":"We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office. ",
        "77":"Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home. ",
        "78":"I know I'm ready for it. I think the American people are too. ",
        "79":"Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools. ",
        "80":"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment. ",
        "81":"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. ",
        "82":"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office. ",
        "83":"And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. ",
        "84":"That is a very serious indictment of this administration. It's probably the worst one of all. ",
        "85":"Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year. ",
        "86":"I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. ",
        "87":"I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions. ",
        "88":"The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. ",
        "89":"The American people are healed, are working together. ",
        "90":"Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. ",
        "91":"Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess. ",
        "92":"I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. ",
        "93":"The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. ",
        "94":"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, 'I believe our nation is greater than what we are now.' ",
        "95":"I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials. ",
        "96":"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation. ",
        "97":"I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense. ",
        "98":"I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised. ",
        "99":"I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it. ",
        "100":"Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military. ",
        "101":"I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown. ",
        "102":"We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. ",
        "103":"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, 'Ford to New York: Drop Dead.' ",
        "104":"I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. ",
        "105":"I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. ",
        "106":"The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich. ",
        "107":"Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy. ",
        "108":"The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess. ",
        "109":"Keep my promises to the American people. ",
        "110":"Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition. ",
        "111":"So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.

",
        "113":"We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished. ",
        "114":"You are robbing the American people of their savings. ",
        "115":"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. ",
        "116":"I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. ",
        "117":"And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. ",
        "118":"And I think that's shocking; it's shameful. ",
        "119":"But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended. ",
        "120":"So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them. ",
        "121":"I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle. ",
        "122":"It will come from the pockets of the people. ",
        "123":"It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. ",
        "124":"It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. ",
        "125":"He went so far as to call it 'brutal economics.' ",
        "126":"We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people. ",
        "127":"And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt. ",
        "128":"With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all. That's the one who is being aborted. ",
        "129":"I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being? ",
        "130":"But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country. ",
        "131":"But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. ",
        "132":"And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.

        "146":"Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford - along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government.

        "147":"In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. ",
        "148":"The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. ",
        "149":"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people. ",

        "161":"The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path. ",

        "172":"And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. ",
        "173":"When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. ",
        "174":"This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds. ",
        "175":"I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all - the Soviet Union. ",
        "176":"I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. ",
        "177":"To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. ",
        "178":"It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. ",
        "179":"But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing. ",
        "180":"Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. ",
        "181":"It would be very disturbing to American people. ",
        "182":"And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. ",
        "183":"This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice. ",
        "184":"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms. This is a formidable force. ",
        "185":"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. ",
        "186":"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country. ",
        "187":"I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation. ",
        "188":"It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. ",
        "189":"I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation. ",
        "190":"He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies. ",
        "191":"These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. ",
        "192":"Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother. ",
        "193":"I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get. ",
        "194":"I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care. ",
        "195":"The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. ",
        "196":"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. ",
        "197":"This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. ",
        "198":"The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. ",
        "199":"Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past. ",
        "200":"In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country. We have made remarkable success. ",
        "201":"But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them. ",

",
        "203":"Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something. ",
        "204":"The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that's just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. ",
        "205":"It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. ",
        "206":"I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great. ",
        "207":"And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great. ",
        "208":"The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. ",
        "209":"I never, ever conceived of such a thing. I never said any such thing. ",
        "210":"But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. ",
        "211":"I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have. ",
        "212":"The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will. ",
        "213":"They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would. ",
        "214":"And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none. ",
        "215":"The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money. ",
        "216":"We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us. It is only in that way that we can persevere. ",
        "217":"I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. ",
        "218":"We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken. ",
        "219":"Groucho Marx said, 'Who do you believe? -- me, or your own eyes?'' ",
        "220":"In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened. And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did. ",
        "221":"I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all. ",
        "222":"This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times. ",
        "223":"I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, 'The buck stops here.\\'\\' ",
        "224":"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation\\'s most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called 'Deadly Gambits,\\'\\' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. ",
        "225":"There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight. One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, 'Deadly Gambits.\\'\\' The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country. Both said that this administration turned down the 'walk in the woods\\'\\' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security. ",
        "226":"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience. ",
        "227":"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union. ",
        "228":"And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer. ",
        "229":"The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. That's dead wrong. ",
        "230":"Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure. ",
        "231":"And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do. ",
        "232":"I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon. And suddenly somebody says, 'Oh, it\\'s got to be up there, and it\\'s Star Wars,\\'\\' and so forth. ",
        "233":"There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go. ",
        "234":"This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation. ",
        "235":"Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck. ",
        "236":"But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement. ",
        "237":"Those of us who served in Vietnam looked at you as a national hero even before you were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. ",
        "238":"When the recession came they were like a deer caught in the headlights -- paralyzed into inaction, blinded to the suffering and pain of bankruptcies and people who were unemployed. ",
        "239":"In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this: 'America is the mockery of the world.' ",
        "240":"I am here because I have in my brain and in my heart what it takes to lead America through tough times. ",
        "241":"It is time for a change. ",
        "242":"There are 2 things that I'm going to stress during this debate: one, Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse -- he will raise your taxes, he will increase spending, he will make government bigger, jobs will be lost; second, Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US. ",
        "243":"The lifeblood of our economy is investment. ",
        "244":"What we do is work on that budget by an aggressive program, not a painful program, so that we can start borrowing less money and getting more investment money on the street through entrepreneurs who can build factories, who will hire people, and maybe we'll start manufacturing goods here in this country again. ",
        "245":"What we do is work on that budget by an aggressive program, not a painful program, so that we can start borrowing less money and getting more investment money on the street through entrepreneurs who can build factories, who will hire people, and maybe we'll start manufacturing goods here in this country again. ",
        "246":"Bill Clinton's top priority is putting America back to work. ",
        "247":"But let's talk -- you know, you keep talking about trickle-down economics and all this stuff, about the worst economy since Hoover. ",
        "248":"It is a bad economy. It's a tough economy. ",
        "249":"Well, we've got to re -- we've got to clean out the barn, if I may quote my boss, and start getting this investment money on the street so we can get, and encourage entrepreneurs to build factories. ",
        "250":"That is absolutely outrageous. ",
        "251":"That's just totally ridiculous. ",
        "252":"Our people will be glad to furnish the press, if they're interested, in Senator Gore's voting record on the Caribbean Basin Initiative. ",
        "253":"By contrast, in the nation as a whole, during the last 4 years, it is the first time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover, that we have gone for a 4-year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4-year period than we had at the beginning. ",
        "254":"So I think that should be eyed with great suspicion, people that are really kicking the props out from under our grand military establishment prematurely. ",
        "255":"Now when I heard George Bush say at the convention in Houston, that when he heard the phrase 'we won the Cold War,' it made him wonder who the 'we' was. Well, I want to tell you, President Bush, the 'we' is the people of the US of America. ",
        "256":"-- the military portions of our plan, even though he was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs under George Bush, and John White has endorsed the economic aspects of our plan, even though I believe he was the architect of Ross Perot's economic plan. ",
        "257":"We won the Cold War because we invested in national security. We won the Cold War because we invested in our military. We didn't win the Cold -- we won the Cold War because we invested in national security. We won the Cold War because America had the political will and made the right decisions. ",
        "258":"We won the Cold War because we invested and we went forward. ",
        "259":"Now when I heard George Bush say at the convention in Houston, that when he heard the phrase 'we won the Cold War,' it made him wonder who the 'we' was. ",
        "260":"Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. ",
        "261":"And he will have a very difficult time dealing with somebody like President Yeltsin or Chancellor Kohl or Prime Minister Major or President Mitterrand, because truth and integrity are prerequisites to being president of the US. ",
        "262":"This issue is an issue that divides Americans deeply. ",
        "263":"I was in Los Angeles recently and I talked to a woman who told me that she had an abortion when she was 17 years of age. And looking back on that she said it was a mistake. ",
        "264":"(APPLAUSE)  That doesn't mean we're pro-abortion; in fact, we believe there are way too many abortions in this country. And the way to reduce them is by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, not vetoing family planning legislation the way George Bush has consistently done. ",
        "265":"That is their agenda -- (APPLAUSE)  And if you support them, don't be surprised that that is exactly what they want to do and that is why Dan Quayle refuses to say this evening that he supports the right of a woman to choose. ",
        "266":"You know, one of the reasons so many Republicans are supporting the Clinton- Gore ticket is because they've turned over the party to this right wing extremist group which takes positions on issues like abortion that don't even allow exceptions for rape and incest. ",
        "267":"You wrote a letter saying that you oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Bill Clinton has the same type of a record. ",
        "268":"Bill Clinton -- Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. 3 words he fears most in the English language. ",
        "269":"He knows all of the little stinky numbers these guys do. ",
        "270":"This election is about the future of our country, not about personal attacks against one candidate or another. ",
        "271":"I think that he insulted the intelligence of the American people and I'm awful proud that the American people rejected that tactic so overwhelmingly that he decided he had made a mistake. ",
        "272":"The US is in deep trouble. ",
        "273":"Three weeks from today, our nation will make a fateful decision. ",
        "274":"Give us a chance. With your help, we'll change this country and we can't wait to get started. ",
        "275":"I think of a woman in Chicago when I was talking to parents about education where she stood up and said I'm sick and tired of these schools in this city being nothing but a factory for failure. ",
        "276":"And is it a negative attack and a personal attack to point out that Bill Clinton simply has trouble telling the truth? ",
        "277":"There will be a job-sucking sound going south. ",
        "278":"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature. ",
        "279":"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go. ",
        "280":"Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us. ",
        "281":"-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more. ",
        "282":"And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people. ",
        "283":"You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it. ",
        "284":"My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war. ",
        "285":"But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling. And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House. ",
        "286":"I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign. ",
        "287":"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn\\'t believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote 'political chameleon' for changing his positions of all times. ",
        "288":"And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years. So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you. ",
        "289":"I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism. ",
        "290":"I've got 5.5 million hard-working people who put me on the ballot, and I belong to them. ",
        "291":"And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning. ",
        "292":"Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down. ",
        "293":"Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements. ",
        "294":"This is not mud slinging. This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year. ",
        "295":"And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs. There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs. ",
        "296":"The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting. These people are hurting in the inner cities. ",
        "297":"And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress. ",
        "298":"Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that. ",
        "299":"I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it. I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it. ",
        "300":"That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year. ",
        "301":"There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period. ",
        "302":"And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately. ",
        "303":"But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing. ",
        "304":"I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation. ",
        "305":"Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it. ",
        "306":"Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime. ",
        "307":"For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together. ",
        "308":"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits. ",
        "309":"I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten. ",
        "310":"I think the American people want it now. Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done. ",
        "311":"For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together. ",
        "312":"And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long. ",
        "313":"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits. ",
        "314":"For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together. ",
        "315":"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits. ",
        "316":"If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight. ",

        "319":"I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children. ",
        "320":"So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. ",
        "321":"This is very important. It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It's terribly important. ",
        "322":"It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped. ",
        "323":"Till you change it you're gonna be unhappy. ",
        "324":"It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages. And it's a big fight. ",
        "325":"The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them. ",
        "326":"Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. ",
        "327":"It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We're doing this all around the world. ",
        "328":"Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse. ",
        "329":"The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change. ",
        "330":"Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. ",
        "331":"If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world. ",
        "332":"And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time. ",
        "333":"And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom. ",
        "334":"Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water. ",
        "335":"It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats. That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign. ",
        "336":"Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children. ",
        "337":"And I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the difficulties that families are having to make ends meet. I talk to parents. I mean, you've got to care. Everybody cares if people aren't doing well. ",
        "338":"I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts. ",
        "339":"And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance. ",
        "340":"I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian . And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight. ",
        "341":"America is the greatest place on the face of the earth. ",
        "342":"But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries. ",
        "343":"I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago. ",
        "344":"I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. ",
        "345":"Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it. ",
        "346":"You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people. ",
        "347":"We are the greatest country on the face of the earth. We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of. ",
        "348":"They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. ",
        "349":"We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago. ",
        "350":"First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. ",
        "351":"But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. ",
        "352":"You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. ",
        "353":"In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it. I wouldn't violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. I'm concerned about healthcare. ",
        "354":"It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke. ",
        "355":"But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. ",
        "356":"Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it's time to have a truce. ",
        "357":"He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote. ",
        "358":"Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program. ",
        "359":"I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. ",
        "360":"So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. ",
        "361":"Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President. These are sophisticated people watching tonight. Millions and millions of Americans. ",
        "362":"You're putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world. ",
        "363":"So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. ",
        "364":"They know the Republican Party hasn't done it. They know the Democratic party won't do it. We ought to agree that somebody else should do it. And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President. ",
        "365":"Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children. And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws. That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me. ",
        "366":"It seems to me that you have a selective memory. ",
        "367":"I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. ",
        "368":"I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar. ",
        "369":"We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. ",
        "370":"But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse. I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator. We need to do this together and we can. ",
        "371":"You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. ",
        "372":"Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill. ",
        "373":"Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President. ",
        "374":"Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election. ",
        "375":"We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations. ",
        "376":"Our military is the strongest military in the world. It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been. ",
        "377":"I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources. ",
        "378":"In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. ",
        "379":"Most people want to see their own doctor. They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We won't threaten anybody. ",
        "380":"So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. ",
        "381":"I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine. ",
        "382":"Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. ",
        "383":"His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike. ",
        "384":"And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. ",
        "385":"Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was. ",
        "386":"But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers. ",
        "387":"So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things. But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year. ",
        "388":"Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim. ",
        "389":"But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. ",
        "390":"I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly. ",
        "391":"It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people. ",
        "392":"Some schools aren't safe. Some schools aren't even safe. Your choice is nothing. ",
        "393":"And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. It's sort of their golden oldie, you know. ",
        "394":"The American people should make up their own mind. ",
        "395":"The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it. ",
        "396":"Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern. George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal. ",
        "397":"So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator. He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better. ",
        "398":"If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children. ",
        "399":"I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history. The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas. ",
        "400":"You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens. ",
        "401":"I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate. ",
        "402":"So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line. ",
        "403":"Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row. ",
        "404":"Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this. ",
        "405":"Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy. ",
        "406":"I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before. You know, so one of your liberal friends. ",
        "407":"And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right. ",
        "408":"He talks about a smaller government. There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs. They're gone. The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not. ",
        "409":"It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed. ",
        "410":"This is the greatest democracy in the world. ",
        "411":"This is a democracy in which we have the freest press and the greatest First Amendment rights in the history of mankind. ",
        "412":"Our education is not up to the standards that the American family and the American people want for their children. ",
        "413":"Clearly, Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve your party best by serving the nation first. ",
        "414":"We have lived through what Jean Kirpatrick called the bloodiest century in mankind's history. ",
        "415":"We have defeated in this system of ours fascism, Nazism, communism, socialism is defunct or debunked around the world, the evil of apartheid has ended. ",
        "416":"Families are under tremendous pressure. People do not -- do not feel safe in their homes. A mother doesn't feel safe sending her child to school. Our schools are not educating. ",
        "417":"And we certainly need to reform this tax code that is a product of this terrible century of war and recession and inflations. ",
        "418":"We need somebody who understands the potential of the American people, who are not just doing well for ourselves, we need to do well for the rest of the world, because they're looking at us. ",
        "419":"This risky scheme that I've described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. ",
        "420":"We ought to be very proud in our country, as most Americans are, that we've made tremendous progress, but we ought to recognize that we have more work to do. ",
        "421":"Now, I want to congratulate Mr. Kemp for being a lonely voice in the Republican party over the years on this question. It is -- it is with some sadness that I refer to the fact that the day after he joined Senator Dole's ticket, he announced that he was changing his position and was hereto, thereafter going to adopt Senator Dole's position to end all affirmative action. ",
        "422":"That when people own something, they have a stake in the American dream. That is Affirmative Action in America. ",
        "423":"With all due respect, I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to end all affirmative action. ",
        "424":"It is a welfare system that is more like a third-world socialist country than what we would expect from the world's greatest democratic free-enterprise system. ",
        "425":"The problems between races in America must be addressed. ",
        "426":"We have people getting access to capital. Small businessmen and women, African-American, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, female Americans would be able to start their businesses. ",
        "427":"It is extremely risky. ",
        "428":"Before I answer that, Jim, let me just say it is disgraceful, the campaign being waged to scare the American senior citizens, in this state and my home state of, well, New York and California, about Medicare. ",
        "429":"A commission is fine, but a commission would not do any good if we adopted this risky $550-billion tax scheme. The word 'scary' has been used. ",
        "430":"Well, as I said before, he used much harsher language when he talked about Bob Dole. ",
        "431":"Our general economy, our national economy, our mainstream economy is democratic, is based on incentives, a small 'd' Al, it\\'s capitalism and incentives for working and saving and investing and producing, and families and the things that really lead to progress up that ladder that we call 'The American Dream,' but is what is really universal. ",
        "432":"Folks, they have no plan. They have absolutely no plan. ",
        "433":"This country is split between those who call themselves pro-choice, and I'm sure, very sincerely, and those of us who call ourselves pro-life, this is a very emotional issue. ",
        "434":"This country should not be torn asunder over this debate, it has to be carried out with civility and respect, and Bob and I believe it can be. ",
        "435":"But even worse than that, as ugly as that might be -- and I know it's a tragedy to many people both on the pro-choice and pro-life position -- we have a President who vetoed a congressional ban on the ugly and gruesome practice of snatching life away from a child just moments before he or she enters the world. That is unacceptable. ",
        "436":"But even worse than that, as ugly as that might be -- and I know it's a tragedy to many people both on the pro-choice and pro-life position -- we have a President who vetoed a congressional ban on the ugly and gruesome practice of snatching life away from a child just moments before he or she enters the world. ",
        "437":"We will never allow a woman's right to choose to be taken away. ",
        "438":"Bob Dole and Jack Kemp will try to remind the American people of what a tremendous asset our children are and why there should be protection for innocent human life, including that of the unborn. ",
        "439":"But to think that this administration vetoed the one chance they had to ban that practice without working with people in the Congress who would have loved to have had the opportunity to stop that gruesome practice is just unacceptable to the American people. ",
        "440":"The platform on which Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole are running pledges a constitutional amendment to take away a woman's right to choose and to have the government come in and order that woman to do what the government says, no matter what the circumstances. Mr. Kemp has voted 47 out of 47 times to have such an amendment and to restrict this completely, no matter what the circumstances, even where rape and incest is involved. ",
        "441":"President Bill Clinton showed tremendous courage, vision, wisdom, and leadership in having our country take the lead in rallying our allies, bringing the warring factions together in Dayton, Ohio, and hammering out a peace agreement that has ended the war in Bosnia. ",
        "442":"To think that Sam Nunn of Georgia or Colin Powell helped put together the coalition in the Persian Gulf were not even consulted. It was not only precipitous, it was a sign, not of strength, but of weakness. ",
        "443":"It's unbelievable that we could cause a drop in the standard of living of a friendly country like Mexico by nearly 40 to 50 percent. ",
        "444":"The United States of America shouldn't be blamed for the management of Mexico's monetary policy. We helped our neighbor in an hour of need, and they survived. They're stronger. They're coming back. They paid us back, and we got a dividend in the process. ",
        "445":"As the President said the other night, there will always be troubles in this ol' world, but the United States of America can be counted on to provide the vision that the world looks for from the United States of America. ",
        "446":"Bill Clinton, as President, has provided that kind of leadership. We are more secure and stronger today because of Bill Clinton's handling of foreign policy. ",
        "447":"We caused problems in the first place by denying Caribbean countries and third-world countries a chance to trade freely in the United States. It causes economic problems and turmoil, and then we turn around, as we did in Mexico, having to bail them out. ",
        "448":"We should have a foreign policy that\\'s predicated upon trade, on spreading democracy, by giving people opportunities to trade freely with us, and making sure that everybody recognizes a rule of the Golden Rule, 'To do unto others to have them do unto you.' ",
        "449":"Diplomacy first, and don't bomb before breakfast. ",
        "450":"Years ago, we used to hear this phrase in American politics, the 'Blame America First' crowd. ",
        "451":"That's dangerous and it's provocative. ",
        "452":"And the mixed message, the ambiguities of U.S. foreign policy, uh are -- I believe, and Bob Dole believes, is causing not only problems for this country throughout the world, but particularly here at home. ",
        "453":"Well, first of all, there are virtually no large differences in the defense budgets put forward by President Clinton and put forward by the majority in the Congress in the last two years. ",
        "454":"This risky $550-billion tax scheme that I talked about earlier is said by the Concord Coalition, including Republicans like Pete Peterson and Warren Rudman, to pose a threat to our nation's ability to have a sensible defense budget in the future. ",
        "455":"President Clinton stopped them dead in their tracks. ",
        "456":"Franklin Roosevelt said in 1932 that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. ",
        "457":"The only thing, Jim, they have to offer is fear. ",
        "458":"This is the most overregulated, overly litigated economy in our nation's history. ",
        "459":"And to call a businessman or woman who sits down and has a chance to express his or her interest in how to make these laws work and call them a polluter is just outrageous. ",
        "460":"They want them to be able to drink clean water and breathe clean air. They don't want them to live next to toxic waste sites. ",
        "461":"That is a reign of terror. It's happening. ",
        "462":"Some have even proposed and this bill he cites would do it, that polluters ought to be paid if they agree to stop dumping poisons into the river. ",
        "463":"We have a positive agenda on the environment because we believe very deeply that it's about our children and our future. ",
        "464":"We should recognize that this country lives in such a way as to build an alliance with our free enterprise system that can build a better America for our children and our grandchildren. ",
        "465":"That is morally and socially unacceptable in a modern day economy. ",
        "466":"We're treading water. We have families that are hurting. We have people who are unemployed. We have people with no property. We have an administration that is demolishing public housing in our inner cities and not providing anything else but more public housing. ",
        "467":"That's just unacceptable, and for Al Gore to keep suggesting that we can't afford to reduce the tax rates across-the-board on the American people and on the formation of the capital necessary to create the new jobs for America is just totally at odds with the experience of both Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and other times in this century. ",
        "468":"Well, to say that this is the best economy in 30 years just staggers the imagination. We have a growth rate of the last four years of about two and a half percent. My friend Al Gore says it  's better than the Reagan years. It isn't. ",
        "469":"Civility, responsibility, racial reconciliation, healing the wounds of our country has to be one of the greatest, most singularly important goals for this country here on the edge of the 21st Century. ",
        "470":"That civility cannot return to our country unless every person feels that they have an equal shot at the American dream. ",
        "471":"We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. ",
        "472":"Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do. ",
        "473":"I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families. ",
        "474":"You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. ",
        "475":"A promise made will be a promise kept. ",
        "476":"Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do. ",
        "477":"For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. ",
        "478":"It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism. ",
        "479":"I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down. ",
        "480":"You know, this man has no credibility on the issue. ",
        "481":"Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families. ",
        "482":"She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans. ",
        "483":"I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money. ",
        "484":"I've had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind. ",
        "485":"I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare. ",
        "486":"Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help. ",
        "487":"It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth. ",

That was a bipartisan act that was adopted. The Anti-Crime Act that has helped to lower crime more than 20% in our country was also bipartisan. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved.

        "574":"So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Now, we trust freedom. ",
        "575":"We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. ",
        "576":"My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. ",
        "577":"But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced. ",

        "583":"My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She's right. ",
        "584":"But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman. ",
        "585":"I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. ",
        "586":"Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. ",
        "587":"The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. ",
        "588":"Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. ",

        "590":"And the 'Los Angeles Times' spent a lot of ink going into that. ",
        "591":"Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. She's worked on it longer than I have. ",
        "592":"Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. ",
        "593":"It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system. ",
        "594":"And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. ",
        "595":"And the budget plan that I\\'ve put out, according to the 'Los Angeles Times' again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. ",
        "596":"There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this. ",
        "597":"Let me just tell you who the jury is. The people of Texas. ",
        "598":"And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person. ",
        "599":"First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system? I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. ",
        "600":"You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. ",
        "601":"In my faith tradition, it is -- it\\'s written in the book of Matthew, 'Where your heart is, there is your treasure also.' ",

        "603":"I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen. ",
        "604":"I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy. ",
        "605":"And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri. ",
        "606":"Government ought to stand on the side of parents. ",
        "607":"Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free. ",
        "608":"But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union. ",
        "609":"We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future. ",
        "610":"And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be. We can. ",
        "611":"A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, DC and therefore they don't want any part of politics. ",
        "612":"I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way. ",
        "613":"I've worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy. ",
        "614":"I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death. ",
        "615":"And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri. And I want to honor that among his other achievements here. ",
        "616":"I'm against quotas. This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring. ",
        "617":"But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases. ",
        "618":"We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today. ",
        "619":"There's too much bitterness in Washington. There's too much wrangling. ",
        "620":"And I had the will of the people in my state behind me. ",
        "621":"But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits. ",
        "622":"If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it. ",
        "623":"And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen. ",
        "624":"One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. ",
        "625":"Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money. ",
        "626":"It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. ",
        "627":"That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading. ",
        "628":"Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair. ",
        "629":"Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else. ",
        "630":"Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world. ",
        "631":"See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy. ",

        "633":"In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure. ",
        "634":"And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you. ",
        "635":"I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax. ",
        "636":"This is a bad tax. ",
        "637":"And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced. ",
        "638":"The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. ",
        "639":"We turned -- this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history. ",
        "640":"And the point is that that's the place where you're most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years. ",

        "646":"This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet. ",
        "647":"Well, Gwen, the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong. ",
        "648":"What the vice president has just said is just a complete distortion. ",
        "649":"Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director's testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. ",
        "650":"There are Republican leaders, like John McCain, like Richard Lugar, like Chuck Hagel, who have said Iraq is a mess and it's getting worse. ",
        "651":"They saw a man who was strong, who had conviction, who is resolute, who made it very clear that he will do everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe. ",
        "652":"Your rhetoric, Senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up. There isn't. ",
        "653":"We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That's part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval. Then, in the mid-'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues. ",
        "654":"If you put American troops in there in larger number and don't get the Iraqis into the fight, you'll postpone the day when you can in fact bring our boys home. ",
        "655":"John Kerry and I will always fight for the American people. ",
        "656":"And the vice president didn't say much about it in your earlier question, but Paul Bremer has now made clear that they didn't have enough troops and they didn't have a plan. ",
        "657":"Have you ever seen America more divided? Have you ever seen Washington more divided? The reality is it is not an accident. ",
        "658":"They were with the drug companies. ",
        "659":"They're with the insurance companies. ",
        "660":"We need to battle them overseas so we don't have to battle them here at home. ",

        "662":"He's the one you will see on the evening news beheading hostages. ",
        "663":"The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction. ",
        "664":"This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton. ",
        "665":"While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. ",
        "666":"How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists? ",
        "667":"And it's important for America to confront the situation in Iran, because Iran is an enormous threat to Israel and to the Israeli people. ",
        "668":"I personally think one of the reasons that we don't have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we've had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business. ",
        "669":"The reason they keep trying to attack Halliburton is because they want to obscure their own record. ",
        "670":"The vice president, I'm surprised to hear him talk about records. ",
        "671":"One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty. ",
        "672":"Here's what's happened: In the time that they have been in office, in the last four years, 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. And it's had real consequences in places like Cleveland. ",
        "673":"During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty. ",
        "674":"You know, if you look at what's happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit. ",
        "675":"They talk about frivolous cases. ",
        "676":"When the vice president was CEO of Halliburton, they took advantage of every offshore loophole available. ",
        "677":"That's not wishy- washy. ",
        "678":"That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you. ",
        "679":"He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power. ",
        "680":"We've got an aggressive brown field program to refurbish inner-city sore spots to useful pieces of property. ",
        "681":"You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it. ",
        "682":"I'm not going to, because that would be pandering. ",
        "683":"He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep -- stop outsourcing. ",
        "684":"Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush. ",
        "685":"Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count? The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business. Dick Cheney's counted as a small business. That's how they do things. ",
        "686":"As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we've been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals. ",
        "687":"And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper. ",
        "688":"And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper. ",
        "689":"The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law. Will we have equal opportunity? Will women's rights be protected? Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards? Will a woman's right to choose be protected? ",
        "690":"But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can't do that. ",
        "691":"It's a brutal practice. ",
        "692":"I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort. ",
        "693":"That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous. ",
        "694":"I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didn't have the armor on those vehicles. They didn't have the right body armor. ",
        "695":"I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton. ",
        "696":"There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war. And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse. ",
        "697":"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, 'And the world would be a lot better off.'. ",
        "698":"I believe America's best days are ahead of us. I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future. ",
        "699":"We're on the move. ",
        "700":"I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe. ",
        "701":"The 9\/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe. ",
        "702":"It's the great nexus. ",
        "703":"The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction. ",
        "704":"We can do this. ",
        "705":"Freedom is on the march. ",
        "706":"Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president. In Iraq, we'll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful. ",
        "707":"And that was the serious, serious threat. ",
        "708":"Think about it: They're going from tyranny to elections. ",
        "709":"Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. ",
        "710":"Somebody called that stubborn. ",
        "711":"And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump. ",
        "712":"But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat. ",
        "713":"We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now they have the bombs and we're less safe. ",
        "714":"For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. ",
        "715":"And if Iraq were to fail, it'd be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous. ",
        "716":"This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support. ",
        "717":"These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill. ",
        "718":"But yes, I'm worried. I'm worried. I'm worried about our country. ",
        "719":"And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable. ",
        "720":"Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year. ",
        "721":"I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. ",
        "722":"We've got battling green eye shades. ",
        "723":"He's just not credible when he talks about being fiscally conservative. He's just not credible. If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps -- the spending caps -- over 200 times. And here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden. It's just not credible. You cannot believe it. And of course he's going to raise your taxes. ",
        "724":"And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. ",
        "725":"But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure. ",
        "726":"One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families. ",
        "727":"They've cut it off. They've stopped it. They don't enforce these kinds of things. ",
        "728":"I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage. ",
        "729":"You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom. ",
        "730":"I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school. ",
        "731":"And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough. ",
        "732":"I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, 'Reading is the new civil right,' and she\\'s right. ",
        "733":"The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. ",
        "734":"One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with. ",
        "735":"But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. ",
        "736":"But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America. ",
        "737":"But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard. ",
        "738":"I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban. ",
        "739":"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, 'See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. ' ",
        "740":"Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. ",
        "741":"But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done. ",
        "742":"And that's hopeful, and that's positive. ",
        "743":"I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. ",
        "744":"I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today. ",
        "745":"And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together. ",
        "746":"My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is. ",
        "747":"The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy. ",
        "748":"John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq. ",
        "749":"I think people understand what she's saying. But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush. ",
        "750":"I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. ",
        "751":"82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. ",
        "752":"This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. ",
        "753":"We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. ",
        "754":"If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. It's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch. ",
        "755":"In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans. ",
        "756":"President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this. He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1. 6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. ",
        "757":"This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that. ",
        "758":"And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. ",
        "759":"I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. ",
        "760":"But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money. But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money. ",
        "761":"My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric. He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times. ",
        "762":"The president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to. ",
        "763":"I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. ",
        "764":"And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them. ",
        "765":"But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. ",
        "766":"But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. ",
        "767":"And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as. ",
        "768":"But I disagree with them, as do many. ",
        "769":"But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. ",
        "770":"It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. ",
        "771":"Medicare belongs to you. ",
        "772":"We got to have health care for all Americans. ",
        "773":"Once again, the president is misleading America. ",
        "774":"So the president's wrong. ",
        "775":"People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. ",
        "776":"Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital. ",
        "777":"Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect. One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. ",
        "778":"And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor-quality health care. ",
        "779":"But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children. ",
        "780":"Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster. ",
        "781":"The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history. ",
        "782":"And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs. Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has. ",
        "783":"The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees. And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent. ",
        "784":"He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for. Not one of them are paid for. ",
        "785":"He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security. ",
        "786":"And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. ",
        "787":"He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. That is an outrageous claim. ",
        "788":"This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that'll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will. ",
        "789":"I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. ",
        "790":"First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. ",
        "791":"This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. ",
        "792":"I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids. Some of them got it for a birthday present. ",
        "793":"And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament. ",
        "794":"I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead. ",
        "795":"But people know where I stand. ",
        "796":"People out there listening know what I believe. ",
        "797":"First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didn't even want to do that. ",
        "798":"The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it. ",
        "799":"My message to our troops is, 'Thank you for what you\\'re doing. We're standing with you strong. We'll give you all the equipment you need. And we\\'ll get you home as soon as the mission\\'s done, because this is a vital mission.' ",
        "800":"When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said: We need you. You've got to help us over there. ",
        "801":"Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. ",
        "802":"That's totally absurd. ",
        "803":"And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers. ",
        "804":"He called them coerced and the bribed. ",
        "805":"But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. ",
        "806":"Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. ",
        "807":"The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, 'Invading Iraq in response to 9\/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor.' ",
        "808":"What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake. ",
        "809":"As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it. ",
        "810":"But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq. ",
        "811":"And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages. The president is the one that said, 'We can\\'t allow countries to get nuclear weapons.' They have. ",
        "812":"He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily. ",
        "813":"And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam. ",
        "814":"The American people decide. ",
        "815":"The only thing consistent about my opponent's position is that he's been inconsistent. ",
        "816":"You know, I think about Missy Johnson. She's a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina. She and her son Bryan, they came to see me. Her husband PJ got killed. He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq. You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way. I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy. ",
        "817":"That's the most noble thing that anybody can do. ",
        "818":"He's a brave, brave man. ",
        "819":"I disagree, strongly disagree with that. ",
        "820":"Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. That's Allawi's assessment. ",
        "821":"The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war. ",
        "822":"So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. ",
        "823":"And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment. ",
        "824":"I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps. ",
        "825":"They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom. ",
        "826":"I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war. And he has. ",
        "827":"As the politics change, his positions change. ",
        "828":"And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, 'Let the inspectors work, or let\\'s, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work,' he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power. ",
        "829":"I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense. ",
        "830":"Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send. ",
        "831":"He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. ",
        "832":"I have no intention of wilting. I've never wilted in my life. And I've never wavered in my life. ",
        "833":"Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea. ",
        "834":"Ask the people in the armed forces today. ",
        "835":"And Colin Powell so stated. ",
        "836":"As George Will said the other day, 'Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.' ",
        "837":"It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted. ",
        "838":"The president did nothing. ",
        "839":"Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn't make sense. You talk about mixed messages. We\\'re telling other people, 'You can\\'t have nuclear weapons,' but we\\'re pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. ",
        "840":"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind. ",
        "841":"And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure. Otherwise, the world won't be better off. ",
        "842":"It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons. ",
        "843":"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table. ",
        "844":"I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. That's the country that I'm going to fight for. ",
        "845":"If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. ",
        "846":"And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. ",
        "847":"And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet. ",
        "848":"Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful. ",
        "849":"Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry. They're hurting, and they're angry. ",
        "850":"They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, DC And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry. ",
        "851":"I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. ",
        "852":"We need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business. Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around. ",
        "853":"The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse. ",
        "854":"But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways. ",
        "855":"That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork. ",
        "856":"There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. ",
        "857":"Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. ",
        "858":"Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations. ",
        "859":"So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush. ",
        "860":"Well, this has been a tough campaign. It's been a very tough campaign. ",
        "861":"That, to me, was so hurtful. ",
        "862":"And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply. ",
        "863":"But to somehow say that group of young women who said 'Military wives for McCain' are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say 'World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,' I\\'m not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they\\'re great citizens. ",
        "864":"And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me. ",
        "865":"Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. ",
        "866":"We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. ",
        "867":"That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up. ",
        "868":"And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years. ",
        "869":"In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries. ",
        "870":"And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression. ",
        "871":"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. ",
        "872":"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. ",
        "873":"I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. ",
        "874":"Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization. ",
        "875":"In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it. ",
        "876":"Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage. ",
        "877":"That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care. ",
        "878":"Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you. ",
        "879":"We have to change the culture of America. ",
        "880":"I think it's always a tragic situation. ",
        "881":"I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in DC Senator McCain's absolutely right: The DC school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. ",
        "882":"Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards. That's not the way we should judge these nominees. ",
        "883":"Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that. And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present. Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present. ",
        "884":"I think we've had a very healthy discussion. ",
        "885":"America needs a new direction. ",
        "886":"There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve. ",
        "887":"I think we all know America is going through tough times right now. ",
        "888":"The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. ",
        "889":"And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead. ",
        "890":"I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children. ",
        "891":"All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government. ",
        "892":"And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway. ",
        "893":"It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. ",
        "894":"And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. ",
        "895":"And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four. ",
        "896":"The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at them. You'll be appalled. ",
        "897":"Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? ",
        "898":"And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington. ",
        "899":"This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. ",
        "900":"Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn't worked. ",
        "901":"And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow. ",
        "902":"And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. ",
        "903":"Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable. ",
        "904":"Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America. ",
        "905":"Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. ",
        "906":"We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. ",
        "907":"And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. ",
        "908":"Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. ",
        "909":"First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. ",
        "910":"Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. ",
        "911":"She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through. ",
        "912":"And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9\/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. ",
        "913":"But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. ",
        "914":"I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. ",
        "915":"It's a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them. ",
        "916":"I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. ",
        "917":"But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. ",
        "918":"And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe. ",
        "919":"And I\\'ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, 'Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\\'s name on it.' He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, 'I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.' And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, 'But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you\\'ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\\'s death was not in vain.' That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don't want defeat. ",
        "920":"I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through. ",
        "921":"The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. ",
        "922":"Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger. ",
        "923":"But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. ",
        "924":"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two. ",
        "925":"So this is a serious threat. ",
        "926":"This is dangerous. It isn't just naive; it's dangerous. ",
        "927":"By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. ",
        "928":"Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. ",
        "929":"I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. ",
        "930":"We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago. ",
        "931":"In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. ",
        "932":"And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. ",
        "933":"And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. ",
        "934":"And this is the greatest country on Earth. ",
        "935":"And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate. ",
        "936":"And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well. ",
        "937":"What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again. ",
        "938":"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America. ",
        "939":"I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. ",
        "940":"I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known. ",
        "941":"If I become president, I'll get America working again. ",
        "942":"If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up. ",
        "943":"I want to get America's economy going again. ",
        "944":"This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it. ",
        "945":"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it? He said, 'I\\'ll get back to you.' And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy. ",
        "946":"President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. ",
        "947":"And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work. ",
        "948":"Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked. ",
        "949":"But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. ",
        "950":"And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time. ",
        "951":"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. ",
        "952":"But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive. ",
        "953":"The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious. ",
        "954":"I resent that comment. ",
        "955":"We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately. ",
        "956":"We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately. ",
        "957":"If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. ",
        "958":"That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. ",
        "959":"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. ",
        "960":"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. ",

        "963":"The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. ",
        "964":"This is the history of dealing with dictators. ",
        "965":"Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world. ",
        "966":"We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. ",
        "967":"I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. ",
        "968":"Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. ",
        "969":"Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: 'To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.' So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible. ",
        "970":"Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. ",
        "971":"My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. ",
        "972":"U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. ",
        "973":"But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment. ",
        "974":"But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment. ",
        "975":"Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. ",
        "976":"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan. ",
        "977":"That's absurd. ",
        "978":"Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it. ",
        "979":"Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together. ",
        "980":"The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues. ",
        "981":"I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice. ",
        "982":"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. ",
        "983":"This is a difficult and sensitive matter. ",
        "984":"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want. ",
        "985":"On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. ",
        "986":"It is actuarially sound. ",
        "987":"Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. ",

        "360":"So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.",

And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws. That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.",
        "366":"It seems to me that you have a selective memory.",

        "371":"You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.",
        "372":"Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.",
        "373":"Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.",

        "388":"Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.",

        "393":"And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.",
        "394":"The American people should make up their own mind.",
        "395":"The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.",

If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps -- the spending caps -- over 200 times. And here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden. It's just not credible. You cannot believe it.  And of course he's going to raise your taxes.",

        "797":"First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.  In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.",
        "798":"The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.",

        "811":"And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages. The president is the one that said, \"We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons.\" They have.",

He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.  You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way.  I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy.",

        "821":"The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.",
        "822":"So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.",
        "823":"And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.",
        "824":"I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.",
        "825":"They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.",
        "826":"I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war. And he has.",
        "827":"As the politics change, his positions change.",
        "828":"And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, \"Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work,\" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.",
        "829":"I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.",
        "830":"Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.",

        "838":"The president did nothing.",
        "839":"Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn't make sense.  You talk about mixed messages. We're telling other people, \"You can't have nuclear weapons,\" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.",
        "840":"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.",
        "841":"And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure. Otherwise, the world won't be better off.",
        "842":"It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",
        "843":"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.",
        "844":"I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.  That's the country that I'm going to fight for.",

        "876":"Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.",

He voted against that.  And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.  Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.

And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq.",
        "906":"We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.",
        "907":"a brazen fashion",
        "908":"those safe havens",
        "909":"First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.",
        "910":"Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.",
        "911":"She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.",
        "912":"enormous problems",
        "913":"a calamitous effect",
        "914":"I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.",
        "915":"It's a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.",
        "916":"I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.",
        "917":"But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.",
        "918":"And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",
        "919":"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \"Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it.\"  He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \"I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.\"  And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \"But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain.\"  That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.",
        "920":"I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.",
        "921":"such an enormous",
        "922":"Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.",
        "923":"General Petraeus",
        "924":"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.",
        "925":"So this is a serious threat.",
        "926":"This is dangerous. It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.",
        "927":"most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth",
        "928":"Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.",
        "929":"I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.",
        "930":"We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.",
        "931":"In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed.",
        "932":"this stubbornness",
        "933":"And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia",
        "934":"this is the greatest country on Earth",
        "935":"And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.",
        "936":"And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.",
        "937":"What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.",
        "938":"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.",
        "939":"I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.",
        "940":"the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known",
        "941":"If I become president, I'll get America working again.",
        "942":"such a sketchy deal",
        "943":"I want to get America's economy going again.",
        "944":"This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.",
        "945":"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it? He said, \"I'll get back to you.\" And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.",
        "946":"outrageous",
        "947":"And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.",
        "948":"Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.  The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.",
        "949":"But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.",
        "950":"those terrible things",
        "951":"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.  And her son had been shot through the head.",
        "952":"But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.",
        "953":"the greatest failure",
        "954":"I resent that comment.",
        "955":"We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.",
        "956":"the tremendous talents that our people have",
        "957":"If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.",
        "958":"in every possible circumstance that we can",
        "959":"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.",
        "960":"this great venture",
        "961":"the battle for freedom",
        "962":"a tremendous load",
        "963":"The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.",
        "964":"This is the history of dealing with dictators.",
        "965":"Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.",
        "966":"We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.",
        "967":"distortion of the facts",
        "968":"Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.",
        "969":"Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: \"To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.\" So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.",
        "970":"Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.",
        "971":"that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war.",
        "972":"any hope for success",
        "973":"and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.",
        "974":"But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.",
        "975":"Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.",
        "976":"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.",
        "977":"That's absurd.",
        "978":"I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.",
        "979":"Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.",
        "980":"The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign",
        "981":"I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.",
        "982":"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.",
        "983":"This is a difficult and sensitive matter.",
        "984":"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.",
        "985":"my best judgment",
        "986":"It is actuarially sound.",
        "987":"the most fantastic program, the worst program",
        "988":"foisted upon it in an election year or any other time",
        "989":"a phony interest rate",
        "990":"Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.",
        "991":"Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.",
        "992":"Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation. We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.",
        "993":"I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain",
        "994":"they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country",
        "995":"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom",
        "996":"I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making",
        "997":"This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country",
        "998":"this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country",
        "999":"I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual",
        "1000":"I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans",
        "1001":"I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom",
        "1002":"I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America",
        "1003":"deadly competition",

        "1009":"I know what it means to be poor",
        "1010":"I know what it means to see people who are unemployed",
        "1011":"In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny",
        "1012":"That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor",
        "1013":"We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration",
        "1014":"We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration",
        "1015":"This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two percent in the Truman years",
        "1016":"somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures",
        "1017":"I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.",
        "1018":"complete uh - economic chaos",
        "1019":"because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",
        "1020":"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",
        "1021":"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",
        "1022":"I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.",
        "1023":"I favor higher salaries for teachers.",
        "1024":"But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.",
        "1025":"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.",
        "1026":"We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter",
        "1027":"It was killed in the Rules Committee.",
        "1028":"it was because the people were against them.",
        "1029":"You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.",
        "1030":"And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",
        "1031":"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need.",
        "1032":"And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.",
        "1033":"nitpicking",
        "1034":"In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.",

        "1041":"The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.",
        "1042":"Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had. I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.",
        "1043":"And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.",
        "1044":"In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.",

        "1046":"Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.",
